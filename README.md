# PRIME-cat-team-pet-hotel

The Pet Hotel project of the Cat Team. This was our first "real" team challenge, where we used Trello to organize tasks and used git to manage code edits. In short, it was a disaster overall. But during the disaster, we learned a ton about project management, git workflow, and general creation of a CRUD application.
